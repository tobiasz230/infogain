# Task description

Assignment and Instructions:
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase. 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar 
spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each 
customer per month and total.
• Use React JS (do not use TypeScript)
• Simulate an asynchronous API call to fetch data
• Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution
• Check solution into GitHub
Checklist
a. WE ARE LOOKING FOR ROCKSTAR, USE THIS ASSIGNMENT TO SHOW US THAT YOU ARE SENIOR 
DEVELOPER
b. Goal of the assignment: showcase great craftsmanship in area of REACT JS. Solution should be 
designed in a way that shows healthy architecture (solutions with 2-3 files will not be accepted). 
Solution should show the data flow and good practices in working with backend from the UI 
perspective
c. Time required: anywhere between 3-6h depending on proficiency
d. Technical guidelines: 
i. Can use https://create-react-app.dev/ to get started quickly
ii. avoid additional frameworks and Typescript – only REACT JS
iii. Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution (can use tools to generate data or 
manually create some data)
iv. Check solution into GitHub and share the URL(Make it Public) 
v. Plan your code composition structure (e.g separate service to simulate API request, 
separate file to calculate points, split UI into few readable files, etc.)
vi. No hardcoded / magic numbers. Use constant definitions/dynamic props 
vii. Code should be clean, nicely formatted, easy to read and understand and follow best 
practices
viii. UI needs to be reasonably OK. Not expecting a fancy UI. 
ix. No errors or warnings in runtime
x. Code must compile and run, there should be an instruction in README.md file how to 
run the application.
xi. Include unit tests
xii. Handle errors after loading application
xiii. Handle data loading – e.g. spinner

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
